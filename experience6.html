                                        We’ve been in restaurants a little while – three generations, to be precise. A long time ago, we embarked on a road trip in search of the
                                        ultimate seafood experience. We traveled down highways and byways, pulled up a seat, put on bibs and soaked up the seafood experience:
                                        the no-name dishes with unforgettable flavor, the fresh-caught oysters and clams piled high, the hand-lettered specials on ancient chalkboards
                                        and the savory simmer of every combination of spices imaginable.

                                        The pleasure of preparing and sharing seafood was simple and genuine and it brought out the best in everyone. We felt as if we’d been welcomed
                                        into somebody’s home when we pulled up a chair. That’s what King’s Fish House is all about and what we bring to you.
