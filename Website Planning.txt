1. Define the Core Purpose (Refined)
   - Your site is mainly a resume/portfolio, so the goal should be:
   - Clearly showcasing your skills, experience, and projects.
   - Being easy to navigate so recruiters/hiring managers can quickly see what you offer.
   - Looking professional and polished.

2. What Features Should Stay?
‚úÖ Keep:
   - Home page (Make sure it gives a strong first impression)
      + Should I do something else instead with my home page or contact info?
      + I'm worried I might start getting unwanted calls/text, etc with my contact info.
   - Experience pages (Consider merging or simplifying)
      + I want to make the experience page display small clickable items for each job.
   - Projects page (Needs to be filled out)
   - Contact page (Make sure it works properly)

ü§î Decide On:
   - The extra experience.html file: If you‚Äôre not using it, maybe remove it for now or replace it with a simpler "Work Experience" section.

‚ùå Remove or Fix:
  - Navigation buttons that don‚Äôt do anything ‚Üí Either remove them or make them functional.
  - Unused sub-items in the dropdown menu ‚Üí If they aren‚Äôt needed, take them out.
  - Progress bar issue ‚Üí Fix or remove it if it's not essential.
  - Gray box behind the footer ‚Üí Likely a CSS issue; I can help troubleshoot.

3. What Features Should Be Removed?
   - If a feature doesn‚Äôt add value or isn‚Äôt finished, remove it for now.
   - Focus on a solid, polished base version you can show off.

4. Design & Structure
‚úÖ Navigation:
   - Keep it simple and functional.
   - Do you prefer a fixed navbar or one that scrolls away?

üé® Colors:
   - Stick with sleek, professional grays and off-white.
   - Do you want any accent colors (e.g., blue for buttons, highlights)?

üî† Fonts & Spacing:
   - If the text is fine, great! Just make sure it‚Äôs easy to read and has good spacing.

5. Finalizing
üîπ Projects Page: Needs content‚Äîlist projects clearly, even if it's just short descriptions for now.
üîπ Fix Navigation Issues: Remove/fix unused buttons and dropdowns.
üîπ Fix the Progress Bar & Gray Box Issue: I can help debug.
üîπ Ensure Everything Works & Looks Good on Mobile.
üîπ Get Outside Feedback: More than just "wow, that‚Äôs cool"‚Äîmaybe ask people what they think could be clearer.
