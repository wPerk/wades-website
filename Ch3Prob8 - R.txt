#####Since problems 7, 8, and 9 use the same data, .csv file labeled "Ch3Prob789"
#####

#Import data from file using location address
Ch3Prob789<- read.csv(file = 'C:\\Users\\Wade\\Documents\\School\\KSU\\STAT 2332\\Online HW\\Ch 3 Online HW Data\\Ch3Prob789.csv')

#Boxplot code. This will create a popup of the boxplot.
boxplot(Ch3Prob789$Caffeine_.mg., horizontal = TRUE)

#There is 1 dot on right side of box plot. This represents 1 outlier.



###ANSWERS###
#
#The summary statistics and the box plot suggest the distribution is approximately (symmetric).
#
#The distribution is centered around (206) and has (lots of) variability, and (one mild outlier).
#	...note to self: I'm pretty sure it is an EXTREME outlier because it is shown on the box plot
#			     as an OPEN circle which means extreme, and CLOSED circle means mild


###FEEDBACK###
#The distribution is not skewed left. A left skewed distribution has a SHORT horizontal
# line on the RIGHT of the IQR box and a long horizontal line on the left of the IQR box.
#
#The box for the IQR has the vertical median line closer Q3 to than Q1.
#
#This distribution s horizontal lines appear to be equal in length.
